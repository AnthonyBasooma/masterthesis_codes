These are the raw codes for my masters study that was published in Heliyon November 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08327). 
The study address the trace metal concentration in the biotic and abiotic components of River Rwizi in western Uganda.

Abstract
Abstract
The distribution of metals in the Rwizi River ecosystem was investigated and human health risks were assessed. 
Samples of water, sediment, damselfly larvae (Ceriagrion glabrum) and fish species (Brycinus sadleri and Barbus altianalis),
were collected at six sites. In all samples the trace elements As, Al, Au, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb, Zn, were quantified. 
Sediment samples near the gold mine had significantly higher concentrations of Hg, Fe and Al although all the concentrations 
were below the probable effect concentrations (PEC). The dissolved concentrations of trace metals were within the European 
standards and WHO drinking water guidelines. However, Fe and Mn concentrations exceeded the standards at three sites. 
The damselfly larvae were good indicators of local metal pollution. 
The fish species accumulated metal levels in the order gills > liver > muscle for most metals except for Hg. M
ultiple regressions between accumulated metals in damselfly with environmental metal levels showed only 
for Au and Cd significant positive relationships. Relating environmental metal levels and 
physicochemical characteristics to the levels in the invertebrates, only for Cu and Pb 
significant relationships were found. With respect to the measured metals, the fish were safe 
for human consumption in most cases although Brycinus sadleri posed a potential health risk due 
to a As hazard quotient (HQ) of 2.2 that exceeded the critical value of 1. 
Similarly, the maximum edible risk-free quantity (Q) for As in Brycinus sadleri was 1.5 g (95 % CI), 
less than the minimum risk free quantity of 31.5 g. In conclusion, the river water was safe for drinking 
but the extraction of gold using Hg should be replaced with an environmentally friendly method
or an effective wastewater treatment should be instituted. People should be cautioned from 
consuming Brycinus sadler i to avoid potential health hazards.
